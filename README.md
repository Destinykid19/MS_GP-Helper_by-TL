Automated random searches with GUI to help you with your Microsoft Rewards daily searches.
Download the folder,
Unpack it,
Start main.py,
enter the data and click search

It's set to open the Edge browser, make sure you are logged in on your browser to get the points.
Per request I can add more Browsers options.

NOTE: Your Windows defender or Anti-Viruses might flag this programm. You'll need to whitelist main.py. It's open source so you can and should check the code before starting it.

Updates: I'll try to add functions like taking the daily surveys, solving the puzzles etc.

Have fun :)
